## Basis

Canterbury Cathedral is adorned with a wide array of stained-glass windows. There are images of religious scenes and figures, but of particular interest to historians will be the windows displaying historical figures. These show that Canterbury Cathedral was an important part of medieval society, and it was seen as a great honour to have yourself represented on the windows of the cathedral. One example of this is the Royal Window located in the cathedral’s north-west transept. This stained-glass window depicts King Edward IV of England (1422-1483), his wife Elizabeth Woodville, Queen Consort of England (1437-1492) and their children from when the window was made in the early 1480s. In the image the family are praying around a prayer table with Edward and Elizabeth kneeling besides it while their children stand further back. The table also bears the royal standard of England at the time to show the importance of those depicted. 

The only parts of the portrait remaining from 1480, however, are the images of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. The other pieces have been either partially or fully reconstructed as the window was smashed and vandalised during the English Civil War by Richard Culmer, a puritan and parliamentarian. The window is also not in its original position as it was moved in the 18th century after an extensive reconstruction of the piece had been completed. 

Stained-glass windows themselves date back to Byzantium, but the practice truly took off in western Europe where it was developed much more and became ubiquitous in churches from the 12th century onwards. Though developments took place, the techniques of constructing stained glass remained the same from the Gothic period until the early 20th century when more modern ways of development were created. But for a stained-glass window created in the 1480s and restored in the 18th century the techniques would’ve been similar. The way of making them was to create pieces of stained glass that would then be cut, painted and then fired before being assembled into patterns or images held together by a series of lead stripes called Cames.

### The King

Edward IV reigned in England from 1461 until he was deposed in 1470 after rebellion, before regaining his throne six months later and ruling for a further twelve years before his death in 1483. He is not widely covered in wider history books but has some truly impressive feats connected to him, notably never losing a battle, like Alexander the Great, and being twice exiled from England but returning and gaining the crown by force on both occasions, though the first time only came about because of the death of his father Richard, Duke of York. It is particularly odd that Edward is not covered more in historical works given that he reigned during the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars fairly popular with wider audiences, as well as his brother being Richard III. He was also a large patron of Canterbury Cathedral, commissioning repairs and several other pieces alongside the Royal Window, including a stained-glass window of his patron saint, Edward the Confessor (another king of England).

Elizabeth Woodville was a very controversial figure in her time, being seen as having risen above her station by many and her family taking up positions other people and families believed to rightfully be theirs. Elizabeth was the daughter of a Lancastrian baron, Lord Rivers, who had taken up arms against Edward and the Yorkists on multiple occasions and her first husband Lord Grey was killed fighting for the Lancastrians at St. Albans. Her fortunes changed in 1464 when Edward became smitten with her and agreed to marry her, angering many lords including the Earl of Warwick. Because of civil strife she was forced into sanctuary in Westminster cathedral on two occasions in her life; the first being in 1470-1 and the second being in 1483. She lived to see her husband die, sons be deposed and disappear and then her eldest daughter become queen consort as she was. 

The two panes to the left of Edward depict his sons, Edward V (then Prince of Wales) and Richard, Duke of York. Edward V was born while his father was in exile in 1470 whilst his brother Richard was born in 1473. Though Edward IV may have been underrepresented in historical works, these two boys most certainly are not. For they are the Princes in the Tower, the boys usurped by Richard III and whose mystery remains largely unsolved to this day. These were two panes reconstructed by the cathedral, but it appears as if they were largely kept as originally intended as they do not have any major signifiers to show what happened to them after the window was originally commissioned. 

Finally, the panes to the right of the queen show the couple’s surviving daughters: the oldest, Elizabeth, followed by Cecily and Anne on the first pane and then Katherine and Mary on the final pane. As with all of the figures, the girls have inscriptions below their pictures describing who everyone was in Latin. The girls, much like the rest of the family, lived complicated lives, first being mooted as brides for foreign rulers, before being used as pawns to thank supporters of first Richard III and then Henry VII.
